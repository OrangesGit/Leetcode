# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

## 1. USE Derived Table

```sql
DELETE FROM Person WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT Id FROM 
(SELECT MIN(Id) as Id FROM Person GROUP BY Email)
Statistical
);
```

## 2. DELETE Directly

```sql
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2 WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;
```





## Appendix

For the first multiple-table syntax, only matching rows from the tables listed before the `FROM` clause are deleted. For the second multiple-table syntax, only matching rows from the tables listed in the `FROM` clause \(before the `USING` clause\) are deleted. The effect is that you can delete rows from many tables at the same time and have additional tables that are used only for searching:

```sql
DELETE t1, t2 FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3
WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id;
```

Or:

```sql
DELETE FROM t1, t2 USING t1 INNER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3
WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id;
```

These statements use all three tables when searching for rows to delete, but delete matching rows only from tables `t1` and `t2`.
