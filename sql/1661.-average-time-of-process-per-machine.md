# 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

## 1. Inner Join

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    a1.machine_Id AS machine_Id,
    ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp),3) AS processing_time 
FROM
    Activity AS a1
    JOIN
    Activity AS a2
    ON
    a1.process_id = a2.process_id
    AND
    a1.machine_Id = a2.machine_Id
    AND
    a1.activity_type = 'start'
    AND 
    a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY
    a1.machine_Id

```

## 2. Inner Operation

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    machine_id,
    ROUND(
        SUM(IF(activity_type = 'start', -timestamp, timestamp)) / COUNT(DISTINCT(process_id)),3
    )AS processing_time
FROM Activity
GROUP BY
    machine_id
```
