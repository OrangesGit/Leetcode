# 4. Array of Products of All Elements Except Itself

```java
class ProductArray  
{  
  public static int[] findProduct(int arr[])  
  {
    
    int temp = 1, len = arr.length;

    int[] result = new int[len];
    for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
      result[i] = temp;
      temp *= arr[i];
    }
    temp = 1;
    for(int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--){
      result[i] *= temp;
      temp *= arr[i];
    }
    // write your code here

    return result; 
   } 
} 
```

## Conclusion

1. Need to consider the existence of 0 \(But there is a way which can ignore the existence of 0\)
2. Create an array named result, of which length is as same as arr's
3. For the result, starts from the left and update the array result based on the following rule, result\[index\] represents the product of elements which is on the left of the index
4. Starting from the right and do the same thing like step3
5. Return the result
